# Stock_Analysis

## Overview of Project
An original VBA script was created to analyze stock information and the stock trading volumes to determine if a stock is worth investing. To improve work efficiency of the stock analysis, I have refactored the coding based on the original VBA script. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to examine whether refactored VBA script runs faster than the origianl VBA script.

The stock data used in this project are 12 stock information from 2017 and 2018 including the stock tickers, ticke rvalue, stock issued date, starting price, closing price and stock trading volumes. 

## Results

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
